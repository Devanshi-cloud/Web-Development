    <h1>How to Become a Rich Woman in 5 Steps</h1>
    <h2>1. Seize your independence</h2>
    <p>If you are dependent on your spouse, a family member, or the government, then you are not in control of your financial future and well-being. The first thing you need to decide is if you want to be dependent… or independent.

        If you choose to be dependent, then you’d better keep your fingers crossed and hope and pray that there will be something there for you down the road—because if you’ve chosen to put your entire financial life, and your future, into the hands of someone else, then you are the ultimate gambler. Good luck!
        
        If, however, you decide you want to be financially independent, read on.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Become a lifelong learner</h2>
    <p>One trait independent women have in common is education, and that doesn't necessarily mean an Ivy League school. It doesn’t even matter if you finished high school, as it’s actually unlikely that a traditional school will teach you any real-world money skills. So where are all the independent women finding their financial education? There are millions of books, seminars, and online resources that offer a wealth of information on money and investing. Start reading, attending workshops, and paying attention to business stories in the news—your financial education will be a mix of those plus real-world experience (once you get in the game, of course).

    <h3>3. Make a plan</h3>
    <p>Ask yourself: What is it that you want to achieve financially? First and foremost, your financial strategy should be based on the concept of cash flow. As an investor, there are two things you can invest for: cash flow and capital gains. What’s the difference?</p>
    <p>Capital gains. You buy a share of stock for $20. You later sell that share for $30. The profit you make is called capital gains. Or you buy a property for $50,000. In two years you sell that property for $75,000. Your profit, or $25,000, is capital gains.</p>
    <p>Cash flow. You buy a share of stock that pays a dividend. You hold onto that stock and every year you are paid a dividend. That dividend is called cash flow. Or you buy a $50,000 property and decide to rent it. Every month you collect the rent, pay the mortgage and other expenses and—If you’ve managed the property well—you’ll make a profit each month. That profit is cash flow.</p>
    <p>The beauty of setting goals and moving forward on the path you’ve set is that once you’re in motion the journey becomes a bit easier. Create a plan and keep it very simple.</p>
    <h4>4. Start small</h4>
    <p>Kim’s first real estate investment was a small, two-bedroom/one-bathroom house. She learned the fundamentals of owning and managing a rental property on that first house. She also made quite a few mistakes. Had she started with a 50-unit apartment building, those mistakes would have cost me so much more.</p>
    <h5>5. Put a little money down</h5>
    <p>One simple action you can take is to research various stocks in companies you have an interest in and buy just two or three shares of one company. Your intelligence regarding the stock market will immediately increase if you pay attention to what’s happening with your stock on a daily basis.
