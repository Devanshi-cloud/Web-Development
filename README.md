In this course on HTML and CSS, I've learned how to create and style web content. Starting with HTML, I gained an understanding of fundamental tags for structuring content, writing articles, and incorporating images. I learned about nesting elements and even experimented with modifying websites using HTML. Interactive elements like buttons and input tags were introduced, and I built a Google clone using these skills.

Transitioning to CSS, I delved into styling by setting widths, using margins and padding for spacing, and manipulating block and inline elements. I grasped the concept of CSS classes and applied various styles to elements, including borders, backgrounds, and fonts. Flexbox became a valuable tool for layout, enabling me to center content efficiently.

As I progressed, I developed more complex projects. I built a digital business card, fine-tuning image placement, adding styles, and using flexbox for layout. In another project, I crafted a space exploration site, incorporating background images, Google fonts, and even text shadows for readability. Additionally, I created a dynamic birthday gift site, employing flexbox for layout, hover effects, and background gradients, making it personalized and appealing.

Finally, I embarked on a solo project, constructing a hometown homepage, showcasing my cumulative skills. Throughout the course, I not only learned the technical aspects of web development but also the creativity and problem-solving required to design and deploy functional and visually appealing websites.
