        Therefore I am. 💪🏻

        Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
        Get my pretty name out of your mouth
        We are not the same with or without
        Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
        Top of the world, but your world isn't real
        Your world's an ideal. So go have fun
        I really couldn't care less
        And you can give 'em my best, but just know
